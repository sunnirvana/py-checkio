# In mathematics, particularly in linear algebra,    a skew-symmetric matrix(also known as an antisymmetric or antimetric) is a square matrixAwhose transpose    is also its negative.    This means it satisfies the equationA = −AT.If the entry in the i-th row and j-th column is aij, i.e.A = (aij)then the symmetric condition becomesaij= −aji.
# 
# You should determine whether the specified square matrix is skew-symmetric    or not.
# 
# You can find more details on Skew-symmetric matrices on itsWikipedia page.
# 
# Input:A square matrix as a list of lists with integers.
# 
# Output:If the matrix is skew-symmetric or not as a boolean.
# 
# Precondition:0<N<5
