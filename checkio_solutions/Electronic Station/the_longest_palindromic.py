# Write a function that finds the longestpalindromicsubstring of a given string. Try to be as efficient as possible!
# 
# If you find more than one substring you should return the one which is closer to the beginning.
# 
# Input:A text as a string.
# 
# Output:The longest palindromic substring.
# 
# Precondition:1 ≤ |text| ≤ 20
# The text contains only ASCII characters.
